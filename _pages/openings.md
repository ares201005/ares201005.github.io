## Open positions

**Postdoc opening**:
We have two postdoctoral openings in our team within the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), focused on advancing research in quantum computing and nuclear quantum dynamics.


**Quantum Computing**

This position centers on developing quantum algorithms at the interface of quantum embedding theory and quantum information science. The successful candidate will work as part of a multidisciplinary team to design and implement quantum-centric embedding algorithms for treating strongly correlated systems, with applications to chemistry and materials science. The project is part of a newly funded effort that integrates fundamental theory with practical quantum algorithm development on emerging quantum hardware. For details and to apply, please visit: Quantum Computing Postdoc Opening or search Job ID: IRC139669 at https://lanl.jobs.

**Nuclear Quantum Dynamics**

This position focuses on the development of quantum dynamics methods for modeling nuclear quantum effects in molecular and condensed phase systems. The candidate will contribute to new theoretical frameworks and computational techniques to capture phenomena such as quantum tunneling, zero-point motion, and coherence effects in complex environments. This work has broad relevance to energy materials, spectroscopy, and chemical reactivity. Candidates with a background in quantum dynamics, theoretical chemistry, or condensed matter theory are encouraged to apply. Additional details will be shared soonâ€”please reach out for more information or to express early interest.


Applications are to be sent to me via [email](mailto:zhy@lanl.gov) or submitted via the LANL job portal: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7352033513690320896/">quantum computing</a> and <a href="">nuclear quantum effect</a>.

<!--
**I currently do not have regular postdoctoral openings. However, exceptional candidates may have opportunities to apply for prestigious Director's or Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowships. Interested individuals are encouraged to contact [Yu Zhang](mailto:zhy@lanl.gov) directly for sponsorship.**

### Director's Postdoc Fellow and Distinguished Fellows

Truly outstanding applicants may apply for prestigious and highly competitive Director's and Oppenheimer's postdoctoral fellowships, which provide the opportunity to pursue independent research. Candidates for these positions need to be nominated by technical staff members. The winners are selected quarterly (Director's Fellow) or annually (Oppenheimer Fellow) and are determined by the strengths of the candidates' research proposals and their academic and research excellence. If you are interested in applying, send <b>a resume, publications list, statement of research interests, and future plans</b>, and arrange for <b>three recommendation letters</b> to Yu Zhang by [email](mailto:zhy@lanl.gov).

### Undergraduate and graduate summer student programs

Center for Nonlinear Studies, Quantum Computing Summer School, and T-1 group at Los Alamos National Laboratory have extensive summer undergraduate/graduate student programs on various topics. The duration of an appointment is usually 1-3 months. We are seeking qualified applicants to work on research projects related to quantum computing for quantum chemistry (and beyond), ab initio many-body methods for strong electron-electron, electron-photon correlations in molecules and quantum materials; electronic, optical, and transport properties of low-dimensional materials; quantum materials and materials dynamics for quantum information science; No previous experience in these areas is required, but a general background in quantum mechanics and solid state physics is desirable.
