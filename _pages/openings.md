## Open positions

**Postdoc opening**: I have an <a href="https://lanl.jobs/Search/JobDetails/cavity-quantum-materials-postdoc-research-associate/9e1cc362-2fe0-4550-be48-516ad5a8efda">opening for a postdoc position</a> in my team within the theoretical division at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).

The candidates will be expected to work in the field of cavity quantum materials, an intersection between cavity quantum electrodynamics and quantum materials.
The successful candidate will contribute to developing and applying quantum many-body methods to investigate the electronic, optical, and dynamical properties of quantum materials in various cavities.
A solid background in electronic structure theory is desired.

The successful candidate will have the opportunity to engage with a dynamic, multi-disciplinary experimental and theoretical research team that bridges fundamental science with applications. We provide unique opportunities for cross disciplinary collaborations, scientific workshop organization, and conference attendance. Outstanding applicants may be nominated for prestigious LANL-funded fellowships, enabling the pursuit of independent research.


Applications are to be sent to me via [email](mailto:zhy@lanl.gov) or submitted via <a href="https://lanl.jobs/Search/JobDetails/cavity-quantum-materials-postdoc-research-associate/9e1cc362-2fe0-4550-be48-516ad5a8efda">LANL job portal</a>.

### Postdoc Fellowships

Truly outstanding applicants may apply for prestigious and highly competitive Director's and Oppenheimer's postdoctoral fellowships, which provide the opportunity to pursue independent research. Candidates for these positions need to be nominated by technical staff members. The winners are selected quarterly (Director's Fellow) or annually (Oppenheimer Fellow) and are determined by the strengths of the candidates' research proposals and their academic and research excellence. If you are interested in applying, send <b>a resume, publications list, statement of research interests, and future plans</b>, and arrange for <b>three recommendation letters</b> to Yu Zhang by [email](mailto:zhy@lanl.gov).

### Undergraduate and graduate summer student programs

Center for Nonlinear Studies, Quantum Computing Summer School, and T-1 group at Los Alamos National Laboratory have extensive summer undergraduate/graduate student programs on various topics. The duration of an appointment is usually 1-3 months. We are seeking qualified applicants to work on research projects related to quantum computing for quantum chemistry (and beyond), ab initio many-body methods for strong electron-electron, electron-photon correlations in molecules and quantum materials; electronic, optical, and transport properties of low-dimensional materials; quantum materials and materials dynamics for quantum information science; No previous experience in these areas is required, but a general background in quantum mechanics and solid state physics is desirable.
