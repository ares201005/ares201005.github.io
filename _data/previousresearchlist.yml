  description_old:  Exascale computing, characterized by its ability to perform calculations at an unprecedented scale, has the potential to revolutionize the study of complex phenomena in materials science and quantum physics. A deeper understanding of the electronic structure, quantum molecular dynamics, and light-matter interactions is essential for developing new materials, advanced quantum devices, and a wide range of other applications. However, the inherent complexity of these problems poses significant computational challenges, often requiring large-scale simulations and intricate algorithms.

  description:  Biological ion channels, the nanoscale gatekeepers in cells, have inspired the creation of artificial counterparts, owing to their essential role in cellular communication and interaction with external environments. Leveraging their potential could spur advancements in numerous fields, including nanotechnology, biomedical devices, and environmental studies. In my research, I developed theoretical models and multiphysics methods to simulate ion transport and pump mechanisms in various artificial channels, encompassing light-driven Ca2+ pump, protein pump and conical pores, showcasing its application in seawater desalination. Additionally, I utilized the developed tools to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms further, laying the groundwork for the emergence of more efficient and innovative artificial ion pumps.

  description:  I developed the time-dependent non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) methods to study for studying light-driven quantum transport phenonemna. The method has been used to understand the ultrafast control of currents through a SiO$_2$-based nanoscale, which recovered the main experimental observations and offers a simple and intuitive picture of the effect of ultrafast light control of currents along nanojunctions. This method was used by my collaborators to successfully predict the real and virtual charges in quantum transport, which was confirmed in a recent experiment [Nature, 605, 251–255 (2022)].

  description: Within the framework of the Non-equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method and many-body perturbation theory, I developed efficient quantum mechanical approaches for simulating nano photovoltaics and light-emitting devices. By developing fast and highly efficient massively parallel algorithms, my method allows the simulation of optoelectronic properties of realistic devices with dozens of thousands of atoms on a few computational nodes. The method has also been extended to study the thin-film devices and extended to integrate with the Maximally Localized Wannier Function-based Tight-Binding (TB) method. Besides, I further developed a multiscale quantum mechanics/electromagnetics method to model the optoelectronics in complex electromagnetic (EM) environments, such as plasmon-enhanced solar cells.
